# Operations Research Analyst - Process Engineer

## Projects
### 1. Operations Research / Data Analytics
#### [Production and Inventory Optimization](https://github.com/dogtortron/inventory-optimization) (January 2025)
- Designed an operations model using Python to optimize capital allocation and production scheduling, increasing profit by 12.8% for a steel manufacturer.

#### [Heuristic Solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://github.com/dogtortron/heuristic-traveling-salesman) (December 2024)
- Built Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem by minimizing the total distance traveled one way to all 36 countries, starting from the United States.

#### [Numerical Analysis of the Trajectory of an Elastic Pendulum](https://github.com/dogtortron/elastic-pendulum-numerical-analysis) (November 2023 - December 2023)
- Studied the trajectory of an elastic pendulum using explicit methods (Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta 4) and implicit methods (Backward Euler, Crank-Nicholson, Adams-Moulton, and Backward-Difference Formula.)

### 2. Chemical Engineering

#### [Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium of the Methane-Ethane Mixture](https://github.com/dogtortron/VLE-methane-ethane) (March 2025) 
- Solved Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium for the Methane-Ethane mixture using the phi-phi method and Peng-Robinson as the Equation of State.

#### [Real-Time Optimization Using First-Principles Modeling](https://github.com/dogtortron/RTO-chemical-plant) (January 2024 - April 2024)
- Developed Python scripts to dynamically optimize reactor operation based on daily commodity prices, and pushed setpoints to a simulated plant via API.
- Analyzed plant profitability under three control scenariosâ€”no optimization, ML-based optimization, and physics-based optimization, and demonstrated significant performance improvement using first-principles RTO.

#### [Dimethyl Ether Plant Design](https://github.com/dogtortron/DME-plant-design) (January 2023 - April 2023)
- Collaborated with three engineers to design a process that can produce 70,000 metric tons per year of 99.9 wt% DME from a feedstock of methanol.
- Performed an economic analysis, yielding a 17% internal rate of return.

#### [BYU Safety & Ethics Case Competition](https://github.com/dogtortron/2022-safety-competition) (December 2021 - January 2022)
- Conducted a detailed Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify potential hazards, including electrostatic discharge (ESD), equipment failure, and fire propagation risks.
- Collaborated in a competitive environment judged by professionals from Northrop Grumman and the AIChE Great Salt Lake Section, gaining insights into lifecycle safety considerations from concept to disposal.
- Won second place.

### 3. Fun and (Sometimes) Useful
#### [U.S. Companies & Their Likelihood To Hire Me](https://github.com/dogtortron/USCIS-data) (March 2025 - Present)
- Built Python scripts to study the trends of international candidate employment.

#### [Sing Like Billy - A Game that Tests Your Auditory Memory](https://github.com/dogtortron/startup) (May 2023 - June 2023)
- Built a web application to test the users' auditory memory.
- (Sorry I stopped paying for AWS so the website is not currently available.)
