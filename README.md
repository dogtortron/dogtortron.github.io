# Operations Research Analyst - Process Engineer

## Projects
### Operations Research / Data Analytics
#### [Production and Inventory Optimization](https://github.com/dogtortron/inventory-optimization) (January 2025)
- Designed an operations model using Python to optimize capital allocation and production scheduling, increasing profit by 12.8% for a steel manufacturer.

#### [Numerical Analysis of the Trajectory of an Elastic Pendulum](https://github.com/dogtortron/elastic-pendulum-numerical-analysis) (November 2023 -December 2023)
- Studied the trajectory of an elastic pendulum using explicit methods (Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta 4) and implicit methods (Backward Euler, Crank-Nicholson, Adams-Moulton, and Backward-Difference Formula.)

### Chemical Engineering

#### [Dimethyl Ether Plant Design](https://github.com/dogtortron/DME-plant-design) (January 2023 - April 2023)
- Collaborated with three engineers to design a process that can produce 70,000 metric tons per year of 99.9 wt% DME from a feedstock of methanol.
- Performed an economic analysis, yielding a 17% internal rate of return.

#### [BYU Safety & Ethics Case Competition](https://github.com/dogtortron/2022-safety-competition) (December 2021 - January 2022)
- Conducted a detailed Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify potential hazards, including electrostatic discharge (ESD), equipment failure, and fire propagation risks.
- Collaborated in a competitive environment judged by professionals from Northrop Grumman and the AIChE Great Salt Lake Section, gaining insights into lifecycle safety considerations from concept to disposal.
- Won second place.
