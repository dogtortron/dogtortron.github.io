# Operations Research Analyst - Process Engineer

## Projects
### 1. Operations Research / Data Analytics
#### [Production and Inventory Optimization](https://github.com/dogtortron/inventory-optimization){:target="_blank"} (January 2025)
- Designed an operations model using Python to optimize capital allocation and production scheduling, increasing profit by 12.8% for a steel manufacturer.

#### [Heuristic Solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://github.com/dogtortron/heuristic-traveling-salesman){:target="_blank"} (December 2024)
- Implemented Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing algorithms using Python to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- Minimized the total distance a person would travel one way to all 36 countries, starting from the United States.

#### [Salt Lake County Bicycle Crash Analysis](https://github.com/dogtortron/SLC-bike-crash-analysis){:target="_blank"} (November 2024)
- Analyzed 14 years of bicycle crash data in Salt Lake County (2010–2024) using Python, K-means clustering, and statistical methods to identify high-risk areas for pedalcyclists.
- Identified canyon roads as higher-risk areas for severe crashes involving pedalcyclists.
- Found intersections to be key hotspots for crashes, emphasizing the need for improved cyclist safety near junctions.

#### [Prototype Vehicle Analysis](https://github.com/dogtortron/prototype-vehicle-analysis){:target="_blank"} (October 2024)
- Applied statistical methods to compute the 99.9% confidence interval for the theoretical mean force on the driver’s front tire (40–50 MPH range).
- Developed a linear regression model using Python's scikit-learn to predict braking force based on speed; validated with residual plots and predicted force at 45 MPH.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and prepared data for multivariate regression incorporating variables such as speed, acceleration, road angle, and wind.

#### [Numerical Analysis of the Trajectory of an Elastic Pendulum](https://github.com/dogtortron/elastic-pendulum-numerical-analysis){:target="_blank"} (September 2023 - December 2023)
- Studied the trajectory of an elastic pendulum using explicit methods (Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta 4) and implicit methods (Backward Euler, Crank-Nicholson, Adams-Moulton, and Backward-Difference Formula).

### 2. Chemical Engineering

#### [Methane-Ethane Mixture Phase Equilibrium Properties Prediction](https://github.com/dogtortron/VLE-methane-ethane){:target="_blank"} (March 2025) 
- Solved the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) equations to estimate both the liquid and vapor mixture fugacity for the Methane-Ethane mixture.
- Used the phi-phi method of phase equilibrium and Peng-Robinson as the equation of state (EoS).
- Compared the predictions of high-pressure, high-temperature phase equilibrium using the Peng-Robinson EoS to real experimental data.

#### [Real-Time Optimization (RTO) Using First-Principles Modeling](https://github.com/dogtortron/RTO-chemical-plant){:target="_blank"} (January 2024 - April 2024)
- Developed Python scripts to dynamically optimize reactor operation based on daily commodity prices, and pushed setpoints to a simulated plant via API.
- Analyzed plant profitability under three control scenarios—no optimization, ML-based optimization, and physics-based optimization, and demonstrated significant performance improvement using first-principles RTO.

#### [Dimethyl Ether Plant Design](https://github.com/dogtortron/DME-plant-design){:target="_blank"} (January 2023 - April 2023)
- Collaborated with three chemical engineers to design a process that can produce 70,000 metric tons per year of 99.9 wt% DME from a feedstock of methanol.
- Performed an economic analysis, yielding a 17% internal rate of return.

#### [BYU Safety & Ethics Case Competition](https://github.com/dogtortron/2022-safety-competition){:target="_blank"} (December 2021 - January 2022)
- Conducted a detailed Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify potential hazards, including electrostatic discharge (ESD), equipment failure, and fire propagation risks.
- Collaborated with two chemical engineers in a competitive environment judged by professionals from Northrop Grumman and the AIChE Great Salt Lake Section, gaining insights into lifecycle safety considerations from concept to disposal.
- Won second place.

### 3. Fun and (Sometimes) Useful
#### [USCIS H-1B Employer Data Analysis](https://github.com/dogtortron/USCIS-data-analysis){:target="_blank"} (March 2025 - Present)
- Built Python scripts to study the trends of international candidate sponsorship in various U.S. companies.
- Optimized search process for international candidates by sorting out a list of companies with a proven track record of hiring internationals from 2015-2024.

#### [Sing Like Billy - A Game that Tests Your Auditory Memory](https://github.com/dogtortron/startup){:target="_blank"} (May 2023 - June 2023)
- Built a web application to test the users' auditory memory.
